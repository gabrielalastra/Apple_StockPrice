<h1 align='center'>APPLE</h1>
<h2 align='center'>Stock Prices Analysis</h2>
<p>Apple is a big and important company and an important shareholder is tired of receiving only monthly updates of the stock price.</p>
<p>The manager says that he would like to see any trends of the stock price specifically for the last 3 months. He also wants this data to be updated daily.</p>
<p>He says it's important for him to know:
  <li>The average monthly stock price</li>
  <li>Daily closing figures</li>
  <li>Volume of stock traded.</li></p>
<p>To create the Apple Database, I used the GoogleSheets with the code:</p>
<code>=GOOGLEFINANCE("AAPL";"all"; "1/1/2020"; "1/12/2022"; "daily")</code>
</br></br>
<p>This Sheet will be updated until December 2022</p>
